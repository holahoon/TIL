# Node Modules


#### Basic
In Node, we don't have access to the `window` object since it's not read in the browser. Rather, it is called `global`.

#### Module
Every file in Node application is considered as `module`. Every variables and functions that are defined in that file are scoped in that `module`. They are not available ouside of that `module`.
