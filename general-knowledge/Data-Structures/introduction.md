# Data Structures Introduction

## What is Algiorithm

Algorithm is a sequence of steps to solve a problem.
It comes in handy when working on complex projects(programs) which may require more sophisticated data storage solutions and computation logic.

### Big-O Notation

It's about how long does an operation take? (expressed in a generalized form; NOT in time units, but in mathematical terms).
